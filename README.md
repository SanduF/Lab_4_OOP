# Lab 4 OOP

I added 2 scenarios for the weekday class : \n
-In case that day rained (This means that noone came to the zoo)\n
-If it was a free day or a holiday(Thi simply adds a +10 toickets to each category)\n
I created a calss method called calamity() and used it 3 diffrent times and each time it dose something diffrent.
