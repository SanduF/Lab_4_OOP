# Lab 4 OOP

I added 2 scenarios for the weekday class :
-In case that day rained (This means that noone came to the zoo)
-If it was a free day or a holiday(Thi simply adds a +10 toickets to each category)
I created a calss method called calamity() and used it 3 diffrent times and each time it dose something diffrent.
